## Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C - Week 2

Today I studied how to plan isPrime function and generalize that.

Also I came to know about diff, but the teachers make us know a little bit, so if I want to use diff I have to search in google and practice about it.

I think there are few courses how to do C programming, so I think I should borrow a book and take a practice with that.
